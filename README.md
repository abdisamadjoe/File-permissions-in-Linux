## Project Description

In this project, you will create a portfolio document to showcase your skills in managing file permissions using Linux commands. You will review and modify file permissions in a given scenario to ensure appropriate authorization and system security. The document will demonstrate your expertise in handling file permissions and can be added to your cybersecurity portfolio to share with prospective employers or recruiters. This exercise involves examining existing permissions, making necessary updates, and documenting the commands and steps used.
